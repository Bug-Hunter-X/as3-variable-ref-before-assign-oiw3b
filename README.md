This repository demonstrates a common error in ActionScript 3 where a variable is used before its declaration, even when it is declared later in the code. This happens because the ActionScript compiler performs a single pass compilation. This can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior. The solution provides a correct version of the code by ensuring all variables are declared before use.
